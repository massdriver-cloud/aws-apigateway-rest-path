## AWS API Gateway REST Path

AWS API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. API Gateway allows you to create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications.

### Design Decisions

- **Modularity**: Each resource and its related configurations are defined in self-contained files, making management and updates more isolated and manageable.
- **Environmental Consistency**: Uses tagging and environment variables to ensure that API Gateway configurations are consistent across different environments.
- **Security**: Integrates closely with AWS IAM roles and policies to ensure secure access and execution.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle traffic loads efficiently, with auto-scaling features built-in.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error messages and gateways responses are configurable to ensure meaningful error communication.

### Runbook

#### Issue: 403 Forbidden Error

This common error occurs when the API Gateway does not have the necessary permissions.

**Check the IAM role policy attached to the API Gateway**

```sh
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name YOUR_API_GATEWAY_EXECUTION_ROLE
```

Ensure the output includes policies that grant necessary permissions.

#### Issue: 404 Not Found Error

Occurs when the requested resource or path is not found.

**Verify the Resource Path Configuration**

```sh
aws apigateway get-resources --rest-api-id YOUR_API_ID
```

Ensure the resource path is correctly listed.

#### Issue: Integration Failures

Failures can occur due to misconfigured integrations with backend services.

**Check the integration request settings**

```sh
aws apigateway get-integration --rest-api-id YOUR_API_ID --resource-id YOUR_RESOURCE_ID --http-method YOUR_HTTP_METHOD
```

Verify correct backend service settings, including endpoints and credentials.

#### Issue: Throttling or Rate Limiting

API requests being throttled due to exceeding the rate limit.

**Check usage plans and API keys**

```sh
aws apigateway get-usage-plan-keys --usage-plan-id YOUR_USAGE_PLAN_ID
```

Ensure the client is using the correct API key and the usage plan is appropriately set.
